three_shapes_game.py is a provided file that predefines methods used in the main() function for three_shapes.py. The graphics used to create the gui are from a provided file as well, graphics.py.

The rules of three_shapes.py are that triangles move around randomly, and "pop" squares, which bounce around the window as if they were not experiencing gravity. Squares "pop" circles, which spawn in with a random x, y velocity and exhibit projectile motion, bouncing off the sides like squres. Circles will then complete the rock-paper-scissors like rules by "popping" Triangles.

custom_program.py simulates blue/green spheres that spawn in the gui who "eat" each other. There is also small purple poisonous spheres that will instantly pop any sphere that touches it.
